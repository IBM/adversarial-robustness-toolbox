Adversarial-Robustness-Toolbox Research Documentation

**Kinetics 400 Exploration**
1. File Formats: Three csv files and three json files: test.csv, train csv, and validate.csv (all the video comes from youtube). There is a youtube_id category that we can get all the video
2. | label | youtube_id | time_start | time_end | split | example link |
   | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
   | drinking beer | --6bJUbfpnQ | 17 | 27 | test | https://youtu.be/--6bJUbfpnQ?t=17 | 
3. Our traing data that located in GIthub over_the_air branch: test.csv, train.csv and validate.csv

**(I3D Exploration)**
1. The over the air research paper link to the https://github.com/google/mediapipe
2. The video inputs to the model need to have the same dimensions batch_size x num_frames x 224 x 224 x num_channels
3. Blockers:  I3D can only support python 3.6 libraries and also Cuda versions
4. SOLVED by using new models mmaction2 https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2 works well on Kinetic 400


**Mideapipe**
1. Preprocessing the video
2. Blockers: only support C++ for video processing
3. SOLVED: After discussion with Mr.Beater from IBM(The head of this Open Source project) we donâ€™t need to preprocess the video

**List out the video label that we are going to use to train**
1. Extinguishing Fire
2. Bartending
3. Ironing
4. Triple Jump
5. Playing Drums
6. Arm Wrestling
7. Planting Trees
8. Juggling Balls
9. Shooting goal soccer
10. High Jump

**Equation that we implement from over-the-air paper(paper_equations.py)**
Notice: The X param is suitable for any dimensions, however the paper only implement 4-dimensional
1.  Tensor p-norm(equation 5)
2.  First Temporal Derivative(equation 7)
3.  Second Temporal Derivative (equation 8): Roll(X,-1) - 2*Roll(X, 0) + Roll(X,1)
4.  Objective Function(Equation 1)
